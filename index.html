                <h1>Bubble Chart of MPG per Cylinder</h1>
                <p>When looking at miles per gallon per vehicle there are a few parameters we can look at. In this
                    instance there are three variables we are interested in: Make, Fuel, and Engine Cylinder count.
                    <br><br>
                    In the scatterplot above we note the Average Highway MPG per Engine Cylinder count with the number
                    of
                    vehicles with those values shown by the size of the circle. The count can be found by hovering over
                    each circle. The color of the circles represent the Fuel type, with purple being Electric, red as
                    Diesel and
                    green as Gasoline.
                    <br><br>
                    An interesting area to note is group of electric vehicles sitting on 0 cylinders. The MPG values are
                    quite high in this area and our sample sizes are small.

            <h1>Bar Chart of Average MPG per Parameter</h1>
            <p>In this scene we are able to see the differences in average MPG by different parameters. By
                clicking on the three parameter buttons above we can see the average highway MPG per that group.
                Using this chart we are able to visually identify parameters or groups that are significantly
                different.
                <br><br>
                Looking at the difference in averages based on Makes shows that Tesla, Hyundai, and Fiat have
                the highest average MPG per make. Grouping by cylinders shows a decrease in average MPG as
                the number of cylinders increase. If we group by fuel we can see that Electric fuel type
                vehicles have a notable difference in average mpg in comparison to gasoline or diesel.

            <h1>Box Plot of MPG per Fuel Type</h1>
            <p>Here we can view the distribution specifics of the average highway MPG grouped by fuel type. By
                hovering over the boxes we are able to see the distribution details.
                <br><br>
                The Electricity group has a median value of 101 with a minimum value of 80 and a maximum value of
                124.
                The entire distrubtion has no overlap with either distrubtion for gasoline or diesel, which have
                median values of
                26 and 29.
                <br><br>
                Based on these distrubtions, it could be suggested that if an individual is purchasing a vehicle and
                in
                interested in maintaining a high MPG they should prioritize purchasing an electric vehicle over
                priortizing Make
                or number of Engine Cylinders (assuming that 0 covers electric vehicles). The bubble chart in the
                initial scene might also suggest there are not many options for electric vehicles in comparison to
                gasoline fuel
                vehicles (based on this dataset).
